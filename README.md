  Hello and Welcome! 👋🏾
</h1>

I'm a Software Engineer and Technical writer. I write programs with C, Shell,
and Python. I used to be a data analyst before I transitioned into software
engineering. I'm passionate about learning, software documentation,
software development, discovering & solving problems (in data management
systems, online retail service delivery, & education), open source and sharing
my knowledge to help others understand technical concepts in the above listed
programming languages. In my leisure time, I enjoy scrolling my twitter TL,
reading books on abstract topics like philosopy & pyschology or playing car
racing video games.
